 ** This project focuses on building a machine learning model  to detect fraudulent credit card transaction. **
 - Data preprocessing : Handled imbalanced Data
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): visualized Transaction patterns, correlation, and class imbalance.
 - Modeling : Implemented and compared multiple algorithms such as  Logistic Regression etc.
 - Evalution Metrics : Used Accuracy, precision,Recall etc.
 - Deployment: Built a simple Streamlit web app to allow users to input transaction details and predict fraud likelihood.
